### Introduction

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of foundation models capable of processing and understanding multi-modal data, such as images and text. These models have shown great promise in various applications, including document analysis, information retrieval, and natural language processing. However, existing approaches often rely on separate encoders for images and text, which limits their ability to fully leverage the interactions between different modalities.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates image and text data at a deeper level. Our model accepts an image of a document and its corresponding OCR output in JSON format, which includes a list of tuples of words and their bounding boxes. The image encoder is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, pre-trained using the BEITv2 approach. Instead of generating image patches directly, our model predicts the CLIP embeddings of these patches, leveraging the rich semantic information captured by CLIP. This approach enhances the model's understanding of the visual content in documents, ensuring robust and high-level visual representations„Äê52‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê53‚Ä†source„Äë.

The text encoder is derived from a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) such as Llama3 or Mistral, adapted using the LLM2Vec approach. This involves enabling bidirectional attention, masked next token prediction (MNTP), and unsupervised contrastive learning using the SimCSE technique. The adaptation from a decoder-only LLM to a strong text encoder allows the model to handle the structured nature of OCR outputs effectively, capturing the contextual and semantic nuances of the text„Äê38‚Ä†source„Äë.

To fuse the text and image embeddings, we employ a Multiway Transformer architecture. This architecture integrates a shared self-attention module and modality-specific feed-forward networks, facilitating deep fusion and processing of multi-modal data. Additionally, we enhance the positional embeddings to incorporate the spatial information of OCR tokens using techniques inspired by "GRPE: Relative Positional Encoding for Graph Transformer," ensuring the model captures the document's layout and structure accurately„Äê44‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê45‚Ä†source„Äë.

Further, we integrate a prompt encoder and a text decoder to enable interactive document analysis and question-answering tasks. The prompt encoder processes user prompts, converting them into embeddings that interact with the integrated text-image embeddings. The text decoder generates the relevant output based on these embeddings, producing sequences of text and corresponding bounding boxes, which map answers to specific regions in the document. This design facilitates tasks such as information extraction and document navigation„Äê61‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê63‚Ä†source„Äë.

Our pre-training strategy involves three key objectives: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM), and Word-Patch Alignment (WPA). These objectives are inspired by techniques from "LayoutLMv3: Pre-training for Document AI with Unified Text and Image Masking," and are designed to enable the model to learn comprehensive multimodal representations effectively. We employ a prompt-based fine-tuning strategy, leveraging instruction tuning to adapt the model to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot setting„Äê45‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê53‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê61‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê63‚Ä†source„Äë.

Our proposed model aims to provide a unified representation that can be used for various downstream tasks, such as document classification, named entity recognition, and document layout analysis. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets, including PubTables-1M and PubLayNet, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
1. We introduce a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates image and text data using a Multiway Transformer architecture.
2. We leverage the BEITv2 approach to pre-train the image encoder with CLIP embeddings, enhancing its semantic understanding.
3. We adapt a pre-trained LLM for text encoding using the LLM2Vec approach, optimizing it for OCR JSON input.
4. We incorporate a prompt encoder and a text decoder to facilitate interactive document analysis and question-answering tasks.
5. We employ a comprehensive pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, demonstrating the model's effectiveness across various downstream applications.

This research advances the state-of-the-art in multi-modal foundation models, providing a robust and flexible framework for document analysis and related tasks.

### Methodology

#### Datasets

**Pre-training Datasets:**
1. **IDL-WDS**: This dataset comprises a diverse collection of document images paired with OCR outputs in JSON format. Each JSON file contains text and corresponding bounding boxes, structured to facilitate the training of models in reading and understanding document layouts. The dataset includes approximately 7,000 rows, offering substantial data for robust pre-training. The documents are processed to determine reading order and columnar structure, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex document formats„Äê11‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê12‚Ä†source„Äë.

2. **PDFA-ENG-WDS**: Derived from the SafeDocs corpus, this dataset focuses on English PDF documents, providing OCR annotations and bounding boxes for words within the documents. It includes metadata such as file sizes and rendering times to optimize loading and processing during training. This dataset, totaling around 1.5TB, is filtered to ensure data quality and consistency, making it ideal for training vision-language models„Äê13‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê14‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê15‚Ä†source„Äë.

**Fine-tuning and Evaluation Datasets:**
1. **PubTables-1M**: This dataset is designed for table detection and structure recognition in documents. It includes extensive annotations for table structures within a large number of document images, making it suitable for evaluating and fine-tuning models for layout detection tasks.

2. **PubLayNet**: PubLayNet provides annotated document images for layout analysis, including text, tables, figures, and headers. The dataset is valuable for tasks like document classification and named entity recognition, offering a rich source of labeled data for fine-tuning multi-modal models.

#### Model Architecture

**Image Encoder:**
The image encoder in our model is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, pre-trained using the BEITv2 approach. BEITv2 leverages a visual tokenizer to convert images into discrete visual tokens, enabling masked image modeling (MIM). Specifically, approximately 40% of image patches are masked, and the model is trained to predict the CLIP embeddings of these masked patches. This technique ensures that the model captures high-level visual representations and is robust in understanding the visual content in documents. The pretraining also involves a [CLS] token to aggregate patch information into global representations, enhancing the model‚Äôs ability to generate comprehensive visual embeddings„Äê52‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê53‚Ä†source„Äë.

**Text Encoder:**
The text encoder utilizes a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) such as Llama3 or Mistral, adapted using the LLM2Vec approach. This process includes enabling bidirectional attention, masked next token prediction (MNTP), and unsupervised contrastive learning using the SimCSE technique. The goal is to transform a decoder-only LLM into a strong text encoder. The steps involve fine-tuning the model to predict masked tokens and using dropout techniques to create positive examples for contrastive learning. This adaptation is crucial for handling the structured nature of OCR outputs, as described in "LLM2Vec: Large Language Models Are Secretly Powerful Text Encoders."

**Integration with Multiway Transformer:**
To integrate text and image embeddings, we employ a Multiway Transformer architecture. Each block consists of a shared self-attention module and a pool of feed-forward networks tailored for different modalities (vision, language, and vision-language). This design facilitates deep fusion of multi-modal data and modality-specific processing, making it highly effective for tasks involving complex interactions between text and images.

**Positional Embeddings for Bounding Boxes:**
We enhance the positional embeddings to incorporate the spatial information of OCR tokens using techniques inspired by "GRPE: Relative Positional Encoding for Graph Transformer." This involves encoding the relative positional relationships between nodes in a graph, specifically tailored for OCR tasks. By embedding this spatial information directly into the transformer's self-attention mechanism, the model captures topological and edge-based relationships between textual elements in a document, improving its performance in tasks requiring an understanding of the document's visual and spatial context.

**Prompt Encoder and Text Decoder:**
After integrating the image and text embeddings using the Multiway Transformer, we incorporate a prompt encoder and a text decoder to facilitate interactive document analysis and question-answering tasks:
- **Prompt Encoder:** This component processes user prompts, converting them into embeddings that interact with the integrated text-image embeddings. The prompt encoder is designed to understand the context and specific requirements of the query, enabling precise and context-aware responses„Äê61‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê63‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Text Decoder:** Based on the embeddings from the Multiway Transformer and the prompt encoder, the text decoder generates the relevant output. The decoder is trained to produce sequences of text and corresponding bounding boxes, effectively mapping answers to specific regions in the document. This allows the model to output not only textual answers but also their precise locations within the document, facilitating tasks such as information extraction and document navigation.

#### Pre-training Strategy

Our pre-training strategy employs three key objectives: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM), and Word-Patch Alignment (WPA). These objectives, inspired by techniques in "LayoutLMv3: Pre-training for Document AI with Unified Text and Image Masking," are designed to enable the model to learn multimodal representations effectively.

1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):**
   - We mask 30% of text tokens using a span masking strategy, where span lengths follow a Poisson distribution. The objective is to maximize the log-likelihood of predicting the masked tokens based on the contextual representations from both text and image sequences. This helps the model learn the correspondence between textual content and layout information.

2. **Masked Image Modeling (MIM):**
   - We mask approximately 40% of image tokens using a blockwise masking strategy. The model is then trained to reconstruct the masked tokens using a cross-entropy loss, encouraging it to interpret visual content through the context provided by both text and image tokens. This objective ensures the model captures high-level visual structures rather than low-level details.

3. **Word-Patch Alignment (WPA):**
   - This objective aligns text words with their corresponding image patches. It involves predicting whether the image patches corresponding to a text word are masked. By assigning binary aligned/unaligned labels to unmasked text tokens based on their image patch masking status, the model learns a fine-grained alignment between text and image modalities. This is critical for tasks requiring precise text-image correspondence.

#### Fine-tuning Strategy

For fine-tuning, we adopt a prompt-based strategy inspired by methods described in the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This approach enables the model to respond appropriately to a variety of prompts, which can be engineered to solve different downstream tasks. The fine-tuning process involves:
- **Instruction Tuning the Text Decoder:** We fine-tune the text decoder to handle diverse downstream tasks by providing it with specific instructions on how to generate the relevant output. This includes producing text sequences and identifying the corresponding bounding boxes in response to different types of queries„Äê61‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê63‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning:** The prompt-based strategy leverages the model‚Äôs pre-trained capabilities to perform tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot setting. By carefully designing prompts, we can adapt the model to various applications such as document layout analysis, document classification, and named entity recognition without extensive additional training„Äê61‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê63‚Ä†source„Äë.

This comprehensive fine-tuning strategy ensures that the model remains flexible and capable of performing a wide range of tasks efficiently, leveraging the strengths of both the pre-trained embeddings and the prompt-based interaction mechanisms.
